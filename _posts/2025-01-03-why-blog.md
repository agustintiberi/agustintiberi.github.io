This blog is a place to think slowly.

It is not meant to chase trends or publish results as soon as they exist.
It is a space to reflect on geospatial data, environmental science, methods,
and the questions that appear along the way :)

Some posts will be technical. Others will be reflective. All of them are part of the same process: learning how to look more carefully.
