I am an ecologist and PhD candidate in Biological Sciences, with strong interest in geospatial data science, satellite remote sensing, and open-source tools. 

#### 🛰️ Geospatial data science to understand our planet 

I work with satellite imagery, geocomputation, and spatial analysis applied to continental aquatic systems. My work focuses on transforming environmental data into insight, combining scientific rigor with reproducible and open workflows.
You can explore my approach, tools, and projects in the portfolio and blog sections. 

#### 💡 Beyond code
When I am not coding or working with data, I enjoy:

- Reading philosophy, art, and history
- Explore the world literature and fiction
- Continuous learning, sharing ideas, and growing through collaboration
